HOW TO BEAT THE ROBOT
=====================

Knowing how the robot works help you come up with relations that confuse it.  
The robot decides whether or not to believe the relation you pick using two methods:
1. language 
2. 2D configuration

## Language

The robot will think it to be true if the relation is a common one, such as *car on road*, *book on table*, *man in front of building*.   
So you would want to avoid these trivial relations and pick some interesting ones, for example, *man under car*.  
**But please be aware that the relation you pick must be true in the image, otherwise it leads to a rejection.**  
Here we show some good examples that the robot didn't expect:
