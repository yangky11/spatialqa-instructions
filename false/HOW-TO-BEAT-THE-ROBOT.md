HOW TO BEAT THE ROBOT
=====================

Knowing how the robot works helps you beat it.  
Since the robot cannot see the image, it's easy to fool it using relations that sound true.  
I suggest that you first pick any two objects in the image, then think about this question: `What relations are likely given these two objects?".`  
**Please notice that the relation you pick must be false in the image.**

Here is a good example:

<img src="helmet-on-man.png" width=400 height=400>
